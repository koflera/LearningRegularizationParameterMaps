Reconstruct dynamic cardiac MR images with the TV-minimization approach for
three different choices of regularization parameters set-ups depending on the
choice of the argument "lambda_mode" in the definition of the network.

"lambda_xyt" --> one scalar regularization parameter for space and time
"lambda_xy_t" --> one scalar regularization parameter for space (x/y) and one for time (t)
"lambda_cnn" --> the proposed spatio-temporal regularization parameter map

>>> N.B. This script is NOT intended to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
Lambda-Map approach over the choice of scalar parameters. The script's purpose
is just to show how to use the pdhg network for reconstruction. <<<

The image used in this script is part of the ACDC dataset and NOT one of the images used for testing
the network in the paper.
As the image differs in many ways (e.g. scaling, contrast, resolution, ...) from the images used in
our paper, it might easily occur that there exists a configuration such that the scalar regularization
parameters actually yield better results than the ones you can obtain with the pre-trained weights
that generate the spatio-temporal Lambda-map.

This can in fact easily occur, since the Lambda-Map (non-linearly) depends on the range of values of the
initial image. A potential remedy to guarantee the applicability of the approach to images
with different scalings could be to apply the CNN to normalized images and scale the output of the
Lambda-Map with values that for example also take into account the operator-norm of the considered
imaging problem. This is left for future work.
